# ðŸ¦  COVID-19 Data Analysis & Visualization

This project analyzes and visualizes global COVID-19 trends using **SQL** and **Tableau**. The dataset includes key metrics such as confirmed cases, deaths, vaccinations, and recoveries, segmented by country, continent, and time.

## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning & Preparation

- The original dataset was cleaned and pre-processed using **Microsoft Excel**.
- It was split into two main tables:
  - `CovidDeaths`
  - `CovidVaccinations`
- These tables were then imported into **SQL Server** for querying and analysis.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

- **Microsoft Excel** â€“ Initial data cleaning and formatting  
- **SQL Server** â€“ Data querying and aggregation  
- **Tableau Public** â€“ Interactive data visualization
